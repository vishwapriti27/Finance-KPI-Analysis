# Introduction

The UK-based chocolate company's  sales team needed clear visibility into their monthly and year-to-date (YTD) performance compared to targets. Leadership wanted a Power BI dashboard to track:

Total Actual vs Target Sales

Variance & Variance %

Team-wise and salesperson-wise performance

Monthly trends highlighting target achievement status


The project objective was to build a Power BI Performance Dashboard that: Shows whether sales targets were met or missed, Highlights top-performing teams and individuals, Provides variance analysis (actual vs target), Enables stakeholders to monitor progress in real-time.


I performed the following steps:

Data Preparation & Cleaning

Consolidated sales data from multiple sources

Structured it into fact & dimension tables

Created calculated measures (Variance, Variance%)


### Power BI Dashboard Development:

Built KPI cards for Actual Sales, Target Sales, and Variance

Designed a monthly trend visualization with color-coded indicators (ðŸŸ¢ met, ðŸ”´ missed)

Added a salesperson-level performance table

Created team-wise YTD sales comparison

Interactivity & Insights

Used slicers & filters for dynamic analysis

Highlighted top performers based on variance %


### Result:

Built a fully interactive Performance Dashboard for the sales team. Identified that only 2 out of 14 months met the sales target and also revealed that Delish & Jucies teams contributed ~60% of total YTD sales.
Report helped management focus on low-performing months & teams for corrective action.
